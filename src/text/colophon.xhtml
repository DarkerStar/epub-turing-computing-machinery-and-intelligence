<h1>Colophon</h1>
<p>
	The text of this e-book was compiled from scans of the original pages 433–460 of Volume 59 (<abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1950) of the journal <i>Mind</i>.
	The text has been very lightly edited to make it slightly more accessible to modern readers (for example, the archaic spelling of “connexion” has been changed to “connection”), without any changes to structure or meaning.
	It is as faithful a reproduction of the text as it appears on those pages as is practical with semantic <abbr>XHTML5</abbr> and <abbr>EPUB</abbr> 3.
	The page numbers are the original page numbers from the source.
