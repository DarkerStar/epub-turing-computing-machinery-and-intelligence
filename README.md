"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" by Alan Turing EPUB ebook
================================================================


"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" was originally a paper published in the
journal "Mind" (Vol. 59, No. 236, Oct. 1950, pp. 433-460) by Alan Turing in
1950. It is a visionary look at the possibility of thinking machines (and its
first section inspired the title of a movie about his life).
